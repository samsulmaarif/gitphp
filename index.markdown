GitPHP is a web frontend for [git](http://git-scm.com/) repositories. It emulates the look of standard gitweb, but is written in PHP and makes use of [Smarty](http://www.smarty.net/) templates for customization.

GitPHP is open source under the [GNU GPLv2](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html).

# Features

Some key features of GitPHP are:

* Support for multiple projects with categories
* Various ways to set up project list (search a directory, hardcoded list, Gitweb/Gitosis/Gitolite project list, [scm-manager](http://www.scm-manager.org/) config)
* Support for viewing common git objects/actions (log, commit, tree, blob, tag, head, file history, blame)
* Syntax highlighting using [GeSHi](http://qbnz.com/highlighter/)
* Unified and side-by-side diffs of commits and files
* Commit and file searching
* Snapshot downloading
* RSS/Atom and OPML feeds
* Multilanguage support
* Caching using files or memcache for performance
* Works with standard [git](http://git-scm.com/) on Linux as well as [Git for Windows](http://msysgit.github.com/)
